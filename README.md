# CLASH: Multimodal 3D Body Shape Prediction

This repository contains the basic code for **CLASH**, a framework for reconstructing 3D human body shapes from multiple tabular modalities, including anthropometric measurements, fat composition, muscle composition, and SMPL β parameters.

## Overview

CLASH learns a shared latent space for multiple modalities using contrastive learning, enabling accurate 3D shape prediction. The current code includes the core training and evaluation pipeline, as well as modules for latent space generation and 3D mesh reconstruction.

## Current Status

- The repository contains the **basic implementation** used for initial experiments.
- Results are provided for demonstration purposes.
- Additional features, optimizations, and dataset integrations will be included in the **camera-ready version**.

## Usage

Instructions for running the code will be provided in the final release. Currently, the repository serves as a minimal working version.
